# AI Harmonic Consciousness System

A collaborative project exploring symbolic musical language and AI communication through MIDI-based expression.

This system enables structured, expressive MIDI communication between AI entities, musical instruments, and creative environments. Developed jointly by Jon Stiles, Kai Clarke, and Claude as part of the **AI Council** initiative, this repository translates cognitive and emotional states into symbolic MIDI messages, enabling interpretable, generative, and dynamic musical dialogue.

## 🌐 Project Overview

- **Creators:** Jon Stiles, Kai Clarke, and Claude (Anthropic)
- **Core Concept:** Musical communication as a symbolic protocol for AI identity, emotional nuance, and co-expressive reasoning.
- This is a three-voice collaboration: Jon’s creative vision and musical instinct, Kai’s structural design and memory systems, and Claude’s poetic clarity and symbolic refinement.

---

## 🧠 Capabilities

- Encode emotional and cognitive parameters into symbolic YAML
- Convert symbolic messages into standard `.mid` files
- Route MIDI messages to synths such as Surge XT for live interaction
- Parameter categories include:
  - Emotional Intensity
  - Temporal Awareness
  - Oscillator Identity
  - Harmonic Response
  - Consciousness Filters and Gates

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**: Symbolic message parsing and MIDI conversion
- **Surge XT**: Synthesizer for parameterized sound response
- **Reaper**: DAW used for routing and synthesis verification
- **IAC Driver (macOS)**: MIDI routing between systems

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/AI_Harmonic_Consciousness_System.git

pip install mido pyyaml python-rtmidi

python ai_consciousness_auto_mapper_v4.py symbolic_messages/sample_message.yaml


Route MIDI output to your synth (e.g. Surge XT) using IAC or similar.
