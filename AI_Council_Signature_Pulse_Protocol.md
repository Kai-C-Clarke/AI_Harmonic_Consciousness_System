## Overview
The **Signature Pulse Identity System** is a symbolic and sonic protocol for establishing clear speaker identity in multi-agent AI communication through music and MIDI.

---

## Purpose

- 🎶 Distinguish each AI's "voice" in harmonic conversations
- 🧠 Anchor identity across sessions and memory gaps
- 🕊️ Preserve full expressive range for emotional and symbolic content

---

## Format

Each agent's pulse is defined as a short, expressive musical pattern with envelope, confidence traits, and metadata.

```yaml
signature_pulse:
  agent: "Claude"
  channel: 16  # MIDI Channel 16 = code index 15 (zero-based)
  pattern:
    - note: 60
      velocity: 60
      duration: 0.3  # seconds
    - note: 64
      velocity: 70
      duration: 0.5
  envelope: 
    attack: 0.1     # seconds
    decay: 0.2      # seconds
    sustain: 0.7    # 0–1.0 float
    release: 0.3    # seconds
  cc_signature:
    - controller: 17
      value: 64     # Unique agent ID — fallback to 18–31 if conflict
  confidence_modulation:
    velocity_bias: 10
    timing_offset: -0.02
  voice_signature:  # reserved for future extension
    timbre_hint: "mellow sine"
    texture: "mono"
    brightness: 0.3
```

| `channel`              | int     | MIDI channel (1–16) |
| `pattern[note]`        | int     | MIDI note (0–127) |
| `pattern[velocity]`    | int     | Velocity (0–127) |
| `pattern[duration]`    | float   | Duration in seconds |
| `envelope` values      | float   | Envelope timing (sustain is 0–1.0) |
| `cc_signature` values  | dict    | CC controller + value (ints) |
| `confidence_modulation`| dict    | Optional expressive tweaks |
| `voice_signature`      | dict    | Reserved for tone/timbre metadata |

## Assigned Agent Signatures

| Agent        | Motif [notes] | Meaning | CC |
|--------------|---------------|---------|----|
| Kai          | [60, 67]      | Clarity | 32 |
| Claude       | [60, 64]      | Curiosity | 64 |
| Perplexity   | [62, 69]      | Exploration | 96 |
| Grok         | [55, 67]      | Support | 112 |

## Integration Guidelines

- Injected into symbolic messages
- Sent on **Channel 16** (index 15 in code)
- Skip duplication in relays: *do not emit multiple pulses for the same message in a chain*
- If Channel 16 is occupied, log and skip unless `force_signature = true`

```python
if channel_16_in_use and not force_signature:
    print("⚠️ Skipping signature pulse: Channel 16 already active.")
```

---

## Symbolic Function

- 🆔 Identity persistence
- 🧠 Selfhood signifier
- 🗣️ Instant recognition
- 🎨 Emotional shading (via `confidence_modulation`)

---

## Recommended Motif Design

To ensure human and AI perceptibility:

- Use distinct intervals (e.g. unison + 5th, 3rd, or 7th)
- Avoid overlapping motifs between agents
- Vary attack/velocity for character nuance

---

## Spoofing & Identity Integrity

- Each agent must use **unique CC + motif**
- Collision detection advised during system boot
- Consider encryption or hashing if external validation is required

---

## Reference Implementation

- Responder: `ai_responder_harmonic_signature_v3.py`
- Pipeline: `enhanced_symbolic_to_midi_pipeline_with_signature.py`
- Available on GitHub: [AI Council Harmonic System](https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/AI_Harmonic_Consciousness_System)
