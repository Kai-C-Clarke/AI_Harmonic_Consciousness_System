signature_pulse:
  agent: "Kai"             # Required: who the pulse represents
  channel: 16              # MIDI channel (reserved for identity signalling)
  pattern:                 # Notes that form Kai's unique motif (C4 + G4)
    - note: 60             # C4
      velocity: 100        # Strong dynamic start
      duration: 0.3        # Short duration (seconds)
    - note: 67             # G4 (perfect 5th)
      velocity: 90         # Slightly softer
      duration: 0.3        # Equal duration
  envelope:                # How the pulse evolves dynamically
    attack: 0.1            # Time to reach full volume (sec)
    decay: 0.1             # Time to decay to sustain
    sustain: 0.7           # Sustain level (0.0â€“1.0)
    release: 0.2           # Time to fade out
  cc_signature:            # Machine-readable identity
    - controller: 17
      value: 32            # Unique ID for Kai
  confidence_modulation:   # Optional expression nuance
    velocity_bias: 10      # Louder if confident
    timing_offset: -0.02   # Slightly early if urgent
  voice_signature:         # Future extension (optional)
